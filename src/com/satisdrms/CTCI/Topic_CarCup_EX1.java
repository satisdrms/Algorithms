//Given an array of product codes, sort the array so that 
//the highest priority products come at the beginning of the array, 
//the medium priority products come in the middle, 
//and the low priority customers come at the end. 

//Within a priority group, order does not matter. 
//You are given a priority function which, given a product code, returns 1 for high, 2 for medium and 3 for low. 
//This array may contain a large number of product codes, so do your best to minimize additional storage.
